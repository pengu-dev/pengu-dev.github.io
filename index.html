        <h1>The Unfolding</h1>
        <p class="date">January 1, 2025</p>
        <p>Last night, a battle. Not of words, but of tears, a relentless storm that shook my chest. I didn't know I was
            so tangled in you, so deeply rooted in your light. An hour and a half, the crying wouldn't stop. Not before,
            not after the message sent into the void. Even now, nine hours later, the grief claws, and every breath
            catches in my throat. How did I become this entangled? You, so amazing, and caring, and sweet, and you. I
            want to call you, to lose myself in the sound of your voice for an entire day, but I can't. Every glance,
            every sound, every stray thought leads me back to you. We’ll be friends, I know, but this feels like a loss,
            a ripping away of something essential. If I could rewind, erase my own “yes,” not because of what followed,
            but to spare you this pain, to shield you from my shortcomings, I would. It was not fair to you, I should've
            known myself better. But you, you're too incredible to not even try. The tears will flow today, that's fine,
            they need to be released. I just hope you are not drowning in the same storm, that the storm in my heart
            isn't crashing on you. I hope to hear your voice soon, to hear the light you hold. The few moments we shared
            will stay with me, I'm so very grateful. You're so amazing, words fail me completely when I try to describe
            you.</p>

        <h1>The Quiet Fall</h1>
        <p class="date">January 1, 2025</p>
        <p>Just hours since the last words, and already, you're a constant echo in my mind. I have work to do, but your
            presence is an unbreakable chain. I'm calm, a strange sort of calm, after telling the others that I need
            some space. The scenarios spin in my head - what if we bump into each other, what if we talk? Awkward, it
            would be awkward, wouldn't it? It feels pathetic, how much I miss you already. It feels too soon. I haven’t
            lost you forever, but I feel a deep regret, a wish that I could be different. The connection, the closeness,
            is a burning brand. Ending it, a choice I know is right, yet I fear I will forever regret. It's for you, I
            tell myself. You deserve to be free, not tied to someone who doesn't share your heart. If we continued, it
            would only get worse, and I'd be dragging you down into a spiral, and I couldn't do that. I hope you’re not
            feeling the weight of this, I hope in a few months we will look back on these times with smiles, as good
            friends. Even without the romance, you're extraordinary. I want to hold on to you for as long as I can.
            Yesterday’s call opened my eyes, revealed the reasons why you hold your freedom so dear. I don’t fault you
            for that. Maybe it was simply the wrong time for us. Maybe one day, when you have your studio, your cat,
            your life, you’ll find someone who will fill your heart with all the love it deserves. I hope you are okay.

        <h1>The Echo</h1>
        <p class="date">January 2, 2025</p>
        <p>You came back, like a whisper, being sweet, cute and adorable. I hesitated, should I be first? The guilt is a
            constant companion. You felt less enthusiastic, as I expected. I hope you're not overthinking your
            responses, even if you called me ‘Donny’ or ‘Honey’ I would have been okay. Those words, my drug. They make
            me feel loved. When should I reach out again? Should I wait for you? Tomorrow? Days from now? I want to
            talk, but I also need to give you the space you need. I understand why I did this, but I know it hurt you. I
            wish I could read your mind, know what you feel about me. Would it be only pain, or some residual warmth?
            The unknown terrifies me. You said you respect my choice, but those are just words. You’re so kind, perhaps
            it was just something you had to say, so I didn't feel as bad. I’ve been listening to music, mostly sad
            songs, and they only bring you back to me. Not in a sad way, but as simply, you. I saw you mention being
            tired. Please tell me it's not because of last night. That would break me more. If I could fix us, fix me, I
            would do it in a heartbeat. </p>

    <div class="entry">
        <h1>Shattered</h1>
        <p class="date">January 3, 2025</p>
        <p>Twenty-four hours now since I broke it all. I'm still shattered, especially seeing you act like nothing is
            wrong. Maybe I wasn't a loss to you after all. Maybe you're just good at pretending. Maybe you actually are
            okay. But I am not okay. I feel like shit seeing you with him. Hearing the giggles, the late-night calls,
            how you "love him the most." Will it ever be okay? Will I ever not feel this every time I see you? The urge
            to cry is a constant hum, but I try to hold back. Too many tears already. It stings, you didn’t check on me
            in private. I expected it, you always so caring and sweet. Makes me feel like a cheap and discarded toy. I
            can't blame you. You said I was playing with your feelings, and maybe I was, unintentionally, but the damage
            is done. The future feels uncertain. I hope I will start to feel better soon. It’s heartbreaking that it’s
            him in that call. Even the thought brings tears to my eyes. I regret everything, but I know this is right. I
            have to deal with my emotions, and I hope you sleep well tonight.</p>

        <h1>The Unseen Silence</h1>
        <p class="date">January 4, 2025</p>
        <p>No green light today. You are absent from the usual spaces. I want to reach out, to type "are you okay?" but
            the words catch. Today is a little better, less tears, five hours of sleep to hide, but overall an
            improvement. The worry creeps back, a constant question of your non-monogamy. You said you’d never be with
            just one person, no official boyfriend, but your actions, they're drawing you to him. Was it that you don't
            want that with me? The private call, him boasting about being with the most beautiful girl, then the move to
            public – was it to hurt? To let me see? I don’t want to believe these thoughts, but coincidences... they
            feel unlikely. Bedtime, the memories flood – late-night calls, the silly jokes, the image of you wearing a
            comfy sweatshirt while talking to me. The way you'd say my name “Donnnyyy”, waiting for my reply. My bed,
            once my safe place, now a graveyard of memories. Each notification, a flicker of hope that's never you. A
            simple “hope you’re doing alright” would mean everything. Maybe your silence is your hurt, a need for space.
            Everything is confused. I just wish I could skip six months, and be done with it.</p>

    <div class="entry">
        <h1>The Empty Space</h1>
        <p class="date">January 6, 2025</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a reprieve. No words written, because the day was full – friends, passion projects, a rare, good
            day. But today, the sleep shattered into fragments, a few hours here, a few there. Even the heavy medication
            offers no solace. My sleep is a unraveling thread. Then, chat, and there you are. A rush of something –
            excitement mixed with dread. I'm both drawn to you and scared shitless. We exchanged coded messages, little
            side glances in the public space. And then the joke – a crude comment, a suggestion of “fucking.” Awkward.
            Uncomfortable. Nothing I can reply to. So, I just let it fall silent. But you, you had to speak. You address
            it, call us “friends,” and then, the line – "he can do it if he wants to, totally up to him." Do you even
            realize? That I WANT TO, but to do that would mean self-destruction. If I didn't run away, I would have just
            drowned in another flood of tears. I'm tired of crying, of this unending sorrow. It’s only been an hour
            since I woke up, but the day already feels strange. Not sadness. Not even loneliness. Just… empty. A void.
            Nothing inside. As I write this, I'm wrapped in a blanket, its warmth a poor imitation of your embrace. It
            will never be. I don't know what else to say, just wanted to speak into this emptiness. I truly hope you are
            okay, and happy. I really do.</p>

        <h1>A Broken Dawn, A Tender Night</h1>
        <p class="date">January 8, 2025</p>
        <p>Yesterday and today, a strange mix of everything. The call with you, that was a beacon, an oasis in the meh
            of the rest. I broke the silence, and I’m okay with it. After I read your vent, I couldn't keep my fingers
            from reaching out, a need to offer reassurance, to try and fill the spaces in your heart that you refuse to
            acknowledge. It's heartbreaking how you see yourself so different from the way I see you. The call
            stretched, five hours, a conversation that moved through every crevice of our lives - our traumas, our
            favorite colors, everything. Then, there was the topic; us. That awkwardness, a tightrope walk above a chasm
            of fear. I
            thought this is it, she'll leave, and I'll never see her. But no. We pushed through, and talked about
            everything. And because of that, it feels like I know you a little bit more. How much you hurt. I felt that
            in my core, which is why I offered the call. It shattered my heart, all the things you say to yourself, your
            pain, the weight you carry. If I could only show you a fraction of the love I hold for you, you would see
            yourself the way I do. It was devastating. And then, your tears. My own threatened to spill. It felt like my
            heart was being squeezed in a fist. I'm glad I called you, that I calmed the storm. And sleeping on the
            phone with you… each small breath, each small puff, they were like music, each one melting my heart. You
            told me I’m the only person you feel like you can open up to, and that is more precious to me than any
            fleeting physical connection. All I want is to see you happy, to see you safe, to see yourself with the same
            light I see you with. That’s the only thing that truly matters. I hope today was better. I hope we talk
            again soon.</p>

        <h1>The Descent</h1>
        <p class="date">January 8, 2025</p>
        <p>Only an hour since the last entry, and the mood is a shattered mirror. How did I manage to feel so positive,
            even for a moment? A fragile lie. The tears...they're back, a free fall, a constant stream after two days of
            dry eyes, and I can't stop them. I don't know why I feel this. I’m just so, so, so sad. Everything is you,
            and the pain that follows. I miss your voice, the way you said my name, and my mind keeps playing that game
            of what you’re doing, and with whom. Maybe it was missing those two days of meds that gave me that feeling
            of being okay… or rather the feeling of nothing. I long for the emptiness, it’s a relief compared to this
            aching pain, emotionally and physically. And the emotional pain isn’t enough, my whole body hurts, it's not
            relaxed, it's all pain, an indescribable discomfort. I was wrong, the worst is not behind me. It's still
            coming, it’s on the horizon, and it looks dark and painful. I’m not sure that I’m strong enough. I just want
            my ship to sink before it reaches me, so I don’t have to face the storm. I can’t eat. Can’t think. Can’t
            function with this feeling. I want you. I want your comfort. I want that sweet voice to tell me it's going
            to be okay, but I can't have that, not right now. He has you, all of you. And I don't want to beg. I don't
            want to drop not-so-subtle hints in public about how fucked I am, but I don't think I need to. I know you’re
            going through your own things, I get it. I just want to be noticed, and loved, and cared for. And I don't
            feel any of that. All I can think is that I wasn't good enough, that I wasn't enough for you to have only
            me. I’m afraid that soon you’ll get into that kind of relationship with someone else, the kind I wanted with
            you, the kind you swore you’d never be in. These are selfish thoughts, I know. I don’t know what you're
            thinking or feeling towards him. All I know is that you didn’t want me in that equation. I tried what you
            suggested, the private call with another girl. It was not romantic or sexual, just me being a sounding board
            for someone else. And the whole time I was only thinking of you. It doesn't matter what I do, what I try to
            think about, what I want, you take up all of my mind. I haven’t eaten in two days. I tried just now, a half
            a sandwich, between the tears, but I have no will to take care of myself. I have so much to do this month
            that I need to be responsible for, and I just don't know how I'm going to do it. It’s like an immovable
            wall. I don't want to sleep, it means I won’t have you on my mind, sleep means going into the bed with all
            the haunted memories between us. Sleeping means loneliness because you're not there. Not there to say, "Good
            night, Donny," not there to say how proud of me you are. You’re just not there. Every single thing is
            overwhelming, even the small things. I need to clean, I can’t. Do the dishes, can’t. Laundry, can’t. All I
            can do is think about you and miss you. I don't want to say it because it would be pathetic, but I think I
            might've actually fallen in love with you. That's the only logical explanation for how I feel. If I wasn't
            needed here, if this would’ve happened a month ago, I would’ve disappeared. I can’t now. Too many people
            depend on me. Too many plans and goals that I'm afraid I'll ruin with my mistakes, and I should've known. I
            should've known I’d fall for someone like you. I just... I just need to feel cared for, and noticed. I have
            so many people saying, “I hope you’re alright,” “I’m here if you need to talk,” but they’re not you. I don’t
            have the same connection, the same attachment with them. You're the only one I want to talk to about this,
            because I only want you. I just want to stop hurting. This feeling of hopelessness, this loneliness, words
            fail. I can’t see the light. Nothing seems like it will ever get better. Why can’t I stop crying, I hate
            myself for this. I just want someone to hold me and tell me it’s going to be okay. But I have no one. I’m
            all alone. I’m tired. I'm tired of fighting. I'm not strong enough. I’m not good enough. Why couldn’t you
            have just loved me the way I do? It’s not fair that I want that, but I do. Please, tell me this crying will
            stop soon. I just can’t anymore. I wish I could just have a heart attack right now and drop-dead. At least I
            wouldn't feel this anymore. At least the pain would stop. </p>

        <h1>Three Days of Quiet</h1>
        <p class="date">January 11, 2025</p>
        <p>Three days of silence. Three days since I pressed pause on everything, since your last message echoed in the
            emptiness. Three days of being alone with my thoughts, sorting through the scattered pieces, trying to make
            some semblance of order. And the most unexpected thing: no tears. A small victory, a tiny crack in the storm
            clouds. I managed to eat a full meal, a greasy, uninspired McDonald's, but a full meal nonetheless. I
            chewed, tasteless, just knowing that my body needed fuel after days of neglect. You are the landscape of my
            mind, always there, a constant horizon. From the first light of the morning, to the last flicker of
            consciousness before sleep, the world is filtered through the lens of you. I’ve taken some steps, small
            hesitant steps, toward piecing myself back together. The apartment is a little less chaotic, my feet have
            felt the earth again, and the dishes are no longer a towering monument to my despair. Small things,
            insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but they are markers on this journey back to something
            resembling myself. The raw, sharp edges of sadness and loneliness have dulled, leaving a hollow space
            behind, a vacant room where you used to live. The quiet, it’s a different kind of pain, a subtle ache. I
            miss your presence, the way you filled the space around me with light. I think of you often: What you're
            doing, where you are, are you feeling better, are you carrying the weight of our story? Therapy, it’s my
            lifeline, a weekly anchor in this sea of uncertainty. I told her everything, and in the telling, the tears
            almost surfaced, those quiet sobs I've been holding back for days. It's a strange feeling, to understand the
            profound loss of you, your warmth, your affection, not just as words, but as a physical absence, an
            invisible wound. There’s this song, this melancholic melody that’s been on repeat. It feels like it
            understands. It’s like the song is my deepest wish, distilled into words: “I wish I was who you drunk texted
            at midnight. Wish I was the reason you stay up till 3, and you can’t fall asleep, waiting for me to reply.”
            I want to be that person, the one you can’t get out of your head, the one you crave. I long to be the cause
            of your sleepless nights, the reason you pick up your phone, desperate for a response. It’s a foolish,
            vulnerable hope, I know. Anyway, tomorrow I’ll step back into the community, a hesitant return to the world.
            I hope to see you there. I long to feel your presence. I miss you, and I want you to be okay. I hope you
            have someone to talk to, someone who sees the beauty I see. </p>
